### Note: ###
  * **Q:** Why are there two separate Sympony v1.0 and Symfony v2.0 projects?
  * **A:** This is because of the requirements of the new Symfony 2 framework. These requirements include a required version of PHP greater than 5.3 wich is tipically not supported in many well known shared-hostings (e.g. USA's Hotmonster, USA's Hostgator, USA's Godaddy, etc). You can refer to [Symfony vs Symfony2 Server-requirements](http://www.symfony-project.org/installation) for more information.


### Progress: ###

  * data modeling, document repository [docs. repository](https://docs.google.com/folder/d/0B5-4n_Z65fjAQmk2ZzRlQ29JM2M/edit)
  * The project is being redesigned
    * Use of html5please api. It already includes boilerplate and TDD. Other features it includes are: CSS created dynamically using ruby's SASS, and backbone.js - underscore.js - JSON
    * An empty Controller and an empty View -in MVC versions of the project: Symfony, JEE, RoR & Django- would make project more customizable. More documentation would be included to explain how to fill these gaps. (updated, 13th July)
